# Well, hello there

<p>Thanks for coming to my hub. I'm still relatively new at using github, but I will fill this up **ASAP**!🖥⌨️💪</p>

### About me

- <p>📖👨‍🎓Currently studying Front-end Develepoment at **Noroff**<7p>
- <p>I've also studied electrical engineering at **USN** where I've learned some back-end as well. <sub>Didn't finish the degree because I switched to front-end.</sub></p>
- <p>I like to experiment with styles to see what works and doesn't, with all the fun stuff that follows.</p>

I'm using my ![home page](https://homepage.nykas.me) to practice what I've learned as well, with this ![repository](https://github.com/YngvN/home-page).

### Other than that

<p>I'm also a musician and a general tech-head that likes to tinker with smart-products within among other things, HomeKit.</p>
