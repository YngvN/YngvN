# Well, hello there

<p>Thanks for coming to my hub. I'm still relatively new at using github, but I will fill this up **ASAP**!🖥⌨️💪</p>

### About me

- <p>📖👨‍🎓Currently studying Front-end Develepoment at **Noroff**<7p>
- <p>I've also studied electrical engineering at **USN** where I've learned some back-end as well. <sub>Didn't finish the degree because I switched to front-end.</sub></p>
- <p>I like to experiment with styles to see what works and doesn't, with all the fun stuff that follows.</p>
