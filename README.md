### Hello, world!

Thanks for coming to my hub. I'm still relatively new at using github, but I will fill this up **ASAP**!

## About me
Currently studying Front-end Develepoment at **Noroff**, but I've also studied electrical engineering at **USN** where I've learned some back-end and PLC as well. <sub>Didn't finish the degree because I switched to front-end.</sub>
I like to experiment with styles to see what works and doesn't, with all the fun stuff that follows.
