# Well, hello there


### About me

- Front-end Develepoment Degree
- I've also studied electrical engineering at *University of South-East Norway* where I've learned some back-end as well. <sub>Didn't finish the degree because I switched to front-end.</sub>
- I like to experiment with styles to see what works and doesn't, with all the fun stuff that follows.
