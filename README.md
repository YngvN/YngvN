# 👋 Well, hello there!

### 🧑‍💻 About me
I'm a front-end developer with a background in electrical engineering, a curiosity-driven mindset, and a love for building smooth, intuitive digital experiences.

- 🎓 **Frontend Development Degree** — Noroff  
- ⚡ Previously studied **Electrical Engineering** at the University of South-East Norway  
  <sub>(Switched paths when I realized UI animations were more fun than Ohm’s law.)</sub>
- 🎨 I enjoy experimenting with design, interactions, and new frameworks to see what truly *feels* good to use.
